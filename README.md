This notebook serves as a personal leetcode solution manual and also includes some personal thoughts. For every level, there is a root directory which provides a list of links to its children.

The first character of all the directory names are uppercase, and those of files' are lowercase.

## Overview

Basically, coding questions are made up of data structures and algorithms. Data structures is about how to store information. Algorithms is about how to use these information based on data structures.

## Three questions to ask

- What data structures to use ?
- What information to store in those data structures ?
- How to use these information ?

## "Searching" problem

The nature of searching problem like BFS, DFS, DP, etc, is about checking all the possible states in current stage.

## Methodology

- Consider about how to design method API, like `reverse(ListNode head)`. What is the meaning of input `head`, and what is the meaning of returned parameter ?
