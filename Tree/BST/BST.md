### Definition
The left subtree and right subtree are also BST.  
All the left nodes are smaller than root, and all the right nodes are greater than root.
### Key points
- __Max node__ in left subtree and __min node__ in right subtree, like [ValidateBST][1].
- Traversal  
	Inorder traversal is ascending order of the whole tree.
### Doubt
How many different balanced BSTs could we produce given a sorted array? Is there any possibility that we can list all of them?
